# Fixing Slow Internet Due to VPNs
If you've been experiencing connectivity issues on Discord and browsers, unrelated to download/upload speeds, a VPN like Radmin or Hamachi might be the cause. I've created a fix for Radmin and can do the same for other VPNs upon request.

## How to Use:
1. Download "RadminOff.exe" from the latest release.
2. Double click "RadminOff.exe" every time you finish using RadminVPN.
3. When you need to use RadminVPN again, launch it and click the Power button. Administrative permissions will be required for necessary services and adapters to be started.
